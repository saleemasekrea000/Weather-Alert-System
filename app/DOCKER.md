# Docker Best Practices

## Stable Builds with Specific Tags

- Used a specific `sha256` hash along with precise tags to ensure stable and reproducible builds.

## Enhanced Security

- Reduced the attack surface by following security best practices, such as running the application as a non-root user and minimizing the number of installed packages.

## Optimized Image Size

- Utilized the `alpine` version of base images to keep the image size as small as possible.

- Combined multiple `RUN` commands to reduce the number of layers in the image.

## Docker Image

- `python:3.12.8-alpine3.21` as the base image (ightweight image)


## Efficient Dependency Management

- Used the `--no-cache-dir` flag with pip to avoid caching downloaded packages, further reducing image size.

## Metadata and Linting

- Added metadata to the image using `LABEL` for better maintainability and traceability.

- used `hadolint` to ensure the Dockerfile adheres to best practices and is free of common issues.

## Improved Build Performance

- Created a `.dockerignore` file to exclude unnecessary files and directories from the build context, speeding up the build process.

## Minimal Dependencies

- Ensured the `requirements.txt` file contains only the essential packages required for the application.

## Efficient Layer Caching

- Ordered instructions in the Dockerfile so that layers that change the least are placed at the top. This maximizes the use of Dockerâ€™s layer caching, reducing build times.
